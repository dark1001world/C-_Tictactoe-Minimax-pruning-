# C++ TicTacToe with Minimax and alpha beta pruning.
## Just Trying to build strong game logics using purely c++, starting with the simplest game of TicTacToe. Aside from the famous Minimax( which is exploring every possible move),
## I also added optimizations such as Alpha beta pruning which i have read about. I also modified the minimax score version with depth, so that the computer tries to win as fast as possible, this will be a stepping stone to bigger games logic.
